# Simulation Environment

* The Simulation environment is a mix of Cocotb + SystemVerilog.
* Existing unit level environments in SV/SV-UVM are retained as is.
* New environments are created using the cocotb framework.
* The simulation env for each module is in the testbench folder. This is a Makefile based cocotb environment.
* The Makefile is customized for VCS, for other simulators replace COMPILE_ARGS, PLUS_ARGS and SIM with the appropriate options.
* The code may contain language artifacts that cannot be processed by opensource simulators like Verilator/Icarus verilog.
* Python version equal to or higher than 3.10 is required to run the simulation.
* Use  test_digital.py as a template for new tests.
* Most of the SOC tests are in` erbium_digital/testbench` folder
